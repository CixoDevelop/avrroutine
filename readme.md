# AvrRoutine lib

This is the avrroutine library file. This library is designed to simplify 
basic operations related to AVR microcontrollers, such as timers, serial, 
and using pins in a way similar to Arduino. In addition to these tasks, 
the library also has support for basic electronic components, such as 
shift registers and H-bridges. Thanks to this library, you don't have to 
write the same thing over and over again in your AVR-based projects if you 
don't want to use Arduino.
